Letting It Out
My promise to myself (and to you)
Jonah
Nov 05, 2025
Facing the fear of starting, setting the first rules, and mapping out the journey ahead.
For a year and half, I’ve been living a paradox. I’m Jonah, a 24-year-old man who has been struggling with the illusion of productivity. In my head, I’m constantly planning, creating, and building. But in reality, the only constant has been a blinking cursor on a blank page, mocking me.

My biggest struggle? The heavy, draining weight of procrastination. I know I want to create something new, but the internal battle to actually start has been crushing. That feeling of potential trapped inside has been killing me.

But I refuse to give up. This Substack is my declaration of war against that inertia. This is the place where I finally let it all out and turn my internal struggle into external, visible action. The time for just thinking is over.

If this struggle sounds familiar, or if you’re curious to see where this journey goes, I’d be honored if you subscribed.
